## Abstract

Implementing a machine learning model to predict whether a message is spam or not. We have created a system that upon receipt of an email message, it will automatically flag it as spam or not, based on the prediction obtained from the machine learning model.

## Steps

To deploy the sage-maker based email spam classification stack, use the cloudformation_assignment3.yaml to deploy the resources.
You will have to use the lambda function to call the endpoint.
